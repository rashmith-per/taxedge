/**
 * Global status-bar policy for TaxEdge.
 *
 * React Native keeps a stack of every mounted <StatusBar>, and the most
 * recently mounted entry wins. Screens underneath the current one (tab
 * screens, earlier stack screens) stay mounted, so a plain <StatusBar> on
 * Home ("light-content") used to leak onto white inner screens and made the
 * status-bar icons invisible (white on white).
 *
 * Rules:
 * 1. <RootStatusBar /> is rendered once in the root layout. It sets the
 *    app-wide default: dark icons, which suit the light TaxEdge screens.
 * 2. Screens or headers that need a different style (dark headers) render
 *    <FocusAwareStatusBar />. It only exists in the stack while its screen is
 *    focused, so it can never leak onto another screen.
 *
 * On Android the app is edge-to-edge, so the bar is always drawn over the
 * app content; only the icon style is applied (background colour and
 * translucency are ignored by the OS). Screens keep using safe-area insets.
